The new API has been marked as <code>Beta</code> and we've begun granting preview access to selected dealers and third-parties. As a reminder to all those that have been given access: Please 
remember that in the coming months we may make changes that may affect the way you interact with the API. Please make test requests to the V4 API, discuss amongst your teams how 
you might go about utilizing the data, but do not expect the V4 API to remain exactly as it is today. We do expect a few changes still so the V4 API is NOT ready for you to invest
a lot of time building your business processes around, yet.

As always, we welcome your feedback on the WPS API and greatly appreciate your comments and suggestions for improvement.
