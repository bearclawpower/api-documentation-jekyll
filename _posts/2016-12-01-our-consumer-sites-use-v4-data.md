The V4 API ushers in a new era for WPS. We've got major initiatives underway to centralize and unify our data management and synchronize our consumer sites in real-time. What this means is when you look at some of our more recent web applications like <a href="http://www.highway21.com" target="_blank">www.highway21.com</a>, <a href="http://www.gmaxhelmetsusa.com" target="_blank">www.gmaxhelmetsusa.com</a>&mdash;what you're seeing is the *same exact data* that is available in Version 4 of our API. Yes, we're consuming our own API in real-time to develop those sites and **you can too**.
