Blocks are essentially a chunk of HTML that we attach to [Products][Products]. Blocks can also have [Images][Images] associated with them, and the references to those are 
typically embedded within the HTML data itself.

The `data` property is a *string* of markup that is commonly included when displaying product detail on the web.
